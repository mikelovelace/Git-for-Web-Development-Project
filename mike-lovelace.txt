	<div class="row">
	  <div>
	  <h2>Header 1</h2>

	  </div>
	</div>
	    
	<div class="row">
	  <h2>Header 3</h2>
	  <p>This is some more paragraph text that will be stylized because the p tag is a direct child 	     of .row as opposed to the other p tags which are NOT direct children to .row but are instead 		     direct children to div
	  </p>  
	</div>
	
	
	this css code would only style the 3rd paragraph tag because it is a direct child of .row

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
       An inline remains on a single line and takes up only the space it needs, where as a block element creates a new line and takes up the full width.
    
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
       When an element is positioned absolute, its parent container becomes the browser itself. Its position ignores the normal flow of the document. If the absolute positioned element is nested inside a relative positioned element, then the relative positioned element becomes the absolute positoned elements parent.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
       display: inline-block;
    
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
       Block - Div, h1, p
       Inline - a, span
       Inline-Block - img
    
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
       The box model contains 4 parts and refers to the margin, border, and padding which  surrounds the 4th part-- the content. Web browsers add default margins, padding, and borders which can make styling html elements more difficult. The fix for this is to use box-sizing: border-box;
